I am Leonardo, a 22 y.o. **Electronics Engineering** student at **Politecnico di Milano** and a team member of **[Dynamis PRC](http://www.dynamisprc.com)**.

I'm really passionate about what I study: I think *engineering is the missing link between our imagination and real world*! Electronics is my field of study: although my Bachelor Degree is in Computer Science, I wanted to figure out what was under it and what makes thing move. That's why I like when both of the two world mix together.

I joined Dynamis PRC, a **Formula Student** racing team in 2022. I work in the **Electronics and Powertrain** department focusing on the *Battery Management System* and the *Accumulator* of our electric car.

When I'm not studying (😅) or messing around with computers and electronics, I love listening to music and play bass, whatching F1 or hanging out and exploring places with my friends.
