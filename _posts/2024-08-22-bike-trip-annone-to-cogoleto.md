Hey! During this summer I’ve done something that come up in my head some time ago. Maybe a bit of a crazy idea, always postponed as something possible, but too far, until this year. 
My friend Stefano and I went on holiday in Liguria in an unconventional way: with our bikes!

The trip looks like this

The trip, divided in 3 days, is also available on Komoot thanks to my dad! I’ll leave link here, if you like looking at the stats!

# Perparation
First I need to say I have never really rode a road bike. My dad used to, and his old bike is still lying around still in perfect conditions!
So, during the previous days, I have done a few short rides to get used to the gear, especially the clipless shoes.
Also the bike preparation was important: at first I wanted to fit all of the needed thing in a few small bags attached to the bike. However I ended up using a really ligthweigth backpack, just to store the extra stuff.

As you can see above, the setup was bretty minimal only to store the stricly necessary. You can see the spare inner tube attached below the seat, a bike bag one the front and two 700ml bottles to store lots of water for long stints.

During the preparation however this setup changed a lot: the front bag moved down between the frame, the spare tube bag moved down over the rear wheel and I added a pouch bag secured with some car ropes to store keys, clothes and a pair of flip flops.
I then added a pair of bike lights bougth at Decathlon (SL 510, really pretty and USB chargeable) to stay safe in case of dark and tunnels, and a really light but shaky phone holder.

The phone was pretty important, to help with navigation and to stay connected. I also synced my Apple Watch data to record the whole run. However, to sustain these really heavy loads, I brought a big (99Wh!) charging bank stored in the front back and that stayed always connected to the phone. Honestly, I think I could've pulled off without charging the powerbank for the whole 2 and a half days. 

So, enough preparation and ready to go! Here is the final setup beyond me and Stefano at the start of the trip.

# Day 1
On 15 August, after a long lunch (15th Aug is National Holiday in Italy) we started our adventure. We started around 5pm, to avoid the midday sun but to arrive in Milan just before sunset.
I started form Annone Brianza, my hometown and reached Stefano after a few km at his house. After a final check on his bike, we overcome the first part of the
