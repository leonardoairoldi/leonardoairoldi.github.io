Hey! During this summer I’ve done something that come up in my head some time ago. Maybe a bit of a crazy idea, always postponed as something possible, but too far, until this year. 
My friend Stefano and I went on holiday in Liguria in an unconventional way: with our bikes!

The trip looks like this:

The trip, divided in 3 days, is also available on Komoot thanks to my dad! I’ll leave link here, if you like looking at the stats!

# Perparation
First I need to say I have never really rode a road bike. My dad used to, and his old bike is still lying around still in perfect conditions!
So, during the previous days, I have done a few short rides to get used to the gear, especially the clipless shoes.
Also the bike preparation was important: at first I wanted to fit all of the needed thing in a few small bags attached to the bike. However I ended up using a really ligthweigth backpack, just to store the extra stuff.

![Bike Setup Preparation](/assets/bike-trip-annone-cogoleto/bike-setup-alpha.jpg)

As you can see above, the setup was bretty minimal only to store the stricly necessary. You can see the spare inner tube attached below the seat, a bike bag one the front and two 700ml bottles to store lots of water for long stints.

![Bike Setup Final](/assets/bike-trip-annone-cogoleto/bike-setup-front.jpg)

During the preparation however this setup changed a lot: the front bag moved down between the frame, the spare tube bag moved down over the rear wheel and I added a pouch bag secured with some car ropes to store keys, clothes and a pair of flip flops.
I then added a pair of bike lights bougth at Decathlon (SL 510, really pretty and USB chargeable) to stay safe in case of dark and tunnels, and a really light but shaky phone holder.

The phone was pretty important, to help with navigation and to stay connected. I also synced my Apple Watch data to record the whole run. However, to sustain these really heavy loads, I brought a big (99Wh!) charging bank stored in the front back and that stayed always connected to the phone. Honestly, I think I could've pulled off without charging the powerbank for the whole 2 and a half days. 

So, enough preparation and ready to go! Here is the final setup beyond me and Stefano at the start of the trip.

# Day 1

<iframe src="https://www.komoot.com/it-it/tour/1791331154/embed?share_token=aAQSJHrPBe56VugwyalB6eKaQIPHIiDBtOxJ4ErEJQ8D85PaaH&profile=1" width="100%" height="700" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

On 15 August, after a long lunch (15th Aug is National Holiday in Italy) we started our adventure. We started around 5pm, to avoid the midday sun but to arrive in Milan just before sunset.
I started form Annone Brianza, my hometown and reached Stefano after a few km at his house. After a final check on his bike, we overcome the first part of the day, a slight uphill road of a few km. This helped a lot getting the feeling of the bike and tweaking our street ride. After a little stop at a friend's house, we continued in a slight refreshing downlhill in the middle of "Brianza" with a beautiful sun just over the horizon. We then passed through small towns and then Monza a beautiful city near Milan. The view and the streets then started to change, we reached Milan! With just enough sunlight remaining, we got through Sesto San Giovanni and then entered Milan, finally reaching my "student" house.
After a good risotto, we went to bed and prepared for the second day.

# Day 2

<iframe src="https://www.komoot.com/it-it/tour/1793521169/embed?share_token=avrt1MDp1OScD8JxYdCKTsuKGNCoHjEMeuCE3YMfNcZ1MeNEc6&profile=1" width="100%" height="700" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

On the second day, we got up at 4.30 to prepare for the day. The bikes were already packed, so we just prepared ourselves and got on the road. We biked from Bicocca through the streets of Milan, from north to south. We stopped at 8am near the "Naviglio" river to have breakfast at 8am. After a cappuccino, we got back on out bikes but fallen immediatly for a begineer's mistake. Stefano's front wheel got stuck in a tram rail that cost him a fall. I was following right behind, so I akwardly fell too after not managing to break on time.

We stopped to make sure it was all ok (fortunatelly yes!). A sweet old lady also helped us with some water and alchool to heal the small bruises. We then returned to our bikes, now proceeding with extra caution on the streets of Milan. After only a few hundreds meter however, we were already out! We then biked along a beautiful cycle path alonogside the "Naviglio Pavese" until Binasco. The bike path was really nice and new, with a good asphalt and away from cars. After that we went through the Ticino Natural Park, where we crossed the Ticino river, a big water course that stands out in the middle of the woods.

![Ticino Photo](/assets/bike-trip-annone-cogoleto/ticino.jpg)

From then, we reached the "Pianura Padana", the largest plain in Italy that spaces across northern Italy. The streets soon become really monotonous as the plains are used mainly for agricolture. Fortunatelly the weather was on our side, and clouds covered the high sun providing some shadow. Otherwise, with no tree in sight, we would've suffered a lot the heat. We stopped to eat our lunch at "Sannazzaro de'Burgondi" a small town in the middle of basically nowhere. Unfortunately, a lot of resturants were closed being the owners on holiday, so we were left with the only option of a kebab.

![Pianura Padana](/assets/bike-trip-annone-cogoleto/pianura-padana-tree.jpg)

After the lunch break, we started to feel the long distance. The muscles were starting to get tired and even mental strenght that got us doing long stints started to vanish. We crossed the Po river on a long bridge, as Po is the longest river in Italy and its pretty large.

<!-- <iframe src="https://leonardoairoldi.github.io/assets/bike-trip-annone-cogoleto/po-video-no-audio.mov" frameborder="0"> </iframe> -->
![Po video](/assets/bike-trip-annone-cogoleto/po-video-no-audio-30MB.gif)

After the Po, we entered the most difficult part of the entire journey. The path was not that difficult, neither technically or phisically being 40km of almost plain roads. However, we started getting tired and began to stop more and more. Finally a relief was reaching Tortona, probably the biggest city we encountered that day after Milan. Tortona not only was a checkpoint, but the view also finally started to change, as we could see in the distance the mountainst that we would've faced the next day. The infinite plains were finally over.

After Tortona we stopped for a long pause at Cassano Spinola to regain our streghts for the last push to our night place. We discovered that Cassano Spinola was one of the "Villages of the Champions", being one of the villages that very famous italians cyclist like Fausto Coppi often crossed in their rides near their hometowns.

The last bit of road was uphill, but the thought of arriving kept us pushing beyond our strenghts. We climbed till Gavi, the place where we booked our B&B for the night. Prepared for closure, a final inconvience: we took a wrong road following Google Maps that brought us on a steep hill that finished on a off road trail! We were tired and out of breath for the climb, but we didn't give up and continued immediatly. We learned our lesson: don't trust Google Maps in bike mode (in 2024), as considers trails feasible and more importantly doesn't take into account the climb! In fact, returning to the Komoot Map, we took the suggested main road that got us to Gavi in less than 30 minutes.
We only used Google Maps in the final meters, to get to the exact location of the B&B.

![Photo Vigneti](/assets/bike-trip-annone-cogoleto/wine-hills.jpg)

The B&B was very nice, it is called [B&B L'Albicocco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Eozg7DU7VqS9Uvdw8) in Gavi. The owner helped us with the bikes, storing them inside the building for the night. We then tried the local food at [Beer & Co](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KkGwvf2Wpy5L65QL7) a resturant in the center of Gavi. The food was veryy nice, and we enjoyed every bite of it. After dinner we were exhausted and immediatly went to sleep only after a quick look at the main streets of the beautiful small village.

# Day 3

<iframe src="https://www.komoot.com/it-it/tour/1795981079/embed?share_token=a9BSCHEHcGoM0f4IyfrAFIo31FvG8HligVxQZzF2PuhrcMn745&profile=1" width="100%" height="700" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

After a long night sleep, we woke up around 7am to prepare for the last day. We slept really really well, thanks to two big beds and all the tiredness from the day before. After a generous breakfast at the B&B, we left around 8.30am. The climb was just ahead of us, as we needed to pass the Appennini to get in Liguria. We decided to go for the "Passo della Bocchetta", as it was the easiest to traverse to get into Genova. The slope gradually started to increase as we passed through small villages near the mountains, like Voltaggio.

![Voltaggio](/assets/bike-trip-annone-cogoleto/voltaggio.jpg)

Following a road alongide a river, we started gaining altitude fast. However in the meantime, the weather started to get worse. Clouds were closing the sky and we feared a thunderstorme before we could reach a safe place at the top. So we decided to give it all, using all our energies knowing that, after the summit, a long downhill road awaited us. 
We reached the top of the mountain pass at Campomorone, at an altitude of 772 m. The last hundreds meters were difficult, but reaching the top was priceless! We stopped for a well deserved rest, with our wind jackets on.

{% include gallery layout="half" id="gallery-top" %}

At the peak we were happier than ever, even if we couldn't still see the sea hiding beyond the mountains. We got on our bike after we made sure it was not going to rain, to have a safe ride downhill. Even though I enjoyed the ride down as it was restful not to pedal, I was not super confident on the bike. The brakes were pretty old (however they worked fine), but most importantly I was not so sure on which position to hold during the descent. I was a bit scared to hold the handlebar on the bottom part as I struggled to reach the brakes with my fingers, probably because their position was not well adjusted.
After a long ride down we finally reaeched Genova, and started to bike on roads that soon become city-like. Komoot was really helpful, for the most part we followed a cycling path along a main road, and so we avoided buisy streets filled with traffic. Even if we had to pedal, we were in perfect shape and the bikes were not tiring at all. 

So, we decided to take a deviation and visit a bit more Genova! As it was noon, we stopped for a "focaccia" in the center of the city. We finally saw the sea, that was an incredible sensation. It was crazy for us to think that we made it till there!

![Bikes Sea](/assets/bike-trip-annone-cogoleto/bikes-sea.jpg)

Last break lunch done, the only final kilometers were ahead of us. Unfortunatly the sun was high and the sky was clear, so the temperature was pretty high. After waiting a bit, we decided to start anyway, as the distance was not too long and we were feeling pretty well. We went again through the streets of Genova, but now going further west to take the Via Aurelia and exit the city. 
A problem with the bike of Stefano made us stop: the seat was coming loose. Fortunatly (thanks to his extreme care in packing) he brought a multitool, that he used to quickly secure the seat again.
Unfortunately, biking through via Aurelia is not too relaxing as the road is tight and a lot of cars are passing by. However, the view on the sea was amazing.
