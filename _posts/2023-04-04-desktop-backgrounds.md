Here are some desktop backgrounds I made over the years. They're not much, but rarely I change desktop background. I even used Windows 11 default theme out of laziness too ðŸ˜… (But I admit it's really good).

Anyway, here are some to download!


## Microsoft Logo
I made this because I wanted a nice black backround. To put something in the middle, why not choose the **colorful Microsoft Logo**? I made this in **Paint.net**, changing slightly the logo colors to flatten them a bit. This wallpaper is in **4K**.

## Beaulieu: The Bay of Fourmis
I found this painting on my lockscreen managed by Bing Spotlight. I immediately fell in love with it! It is a painting of **EugÃ¨ne Boudin**, exposed at [The Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/435750)

## Blue Marble
I have always been fascinated by space exploration. As a kid I always looked up and wondered what the astronauts of Apollo's missions looked at while travelling on their stunning Apollo Command and Service Module.

This wallpaper is my **all time favourite**, it is a photo called **"Blue Marble"** taken in *December 7, 1972* by the Apollo 17 crew. I centered it and made the earth look reeeally small, as if we were seeing it from near the moon. This wallpaper is in **4K**.

I tried also doing a sketch-up version of the wallpaper, but it did not turn out great and I have basically never used it. However, I think the idea is good and maybe someone who can draw can make a better version!

## Equations
For this wallpaper I wanted something like a blackboard on my screen. I searched online and found nothing, but then I realized I already seen something like that! The **Telegram** app has some cool background patterns and this one was perfect. 

I found the pattern file online and with GIMP created some versions of the wallpaper. 
The first two are **FullHD**:

This two are **FullHD**, but the pattern is smaller:
