I am Leonardo, a 22 y.o. **Electronics Engineering** student at **Politecnico di Milano** and a team member of **[Dynamis PRC](http://www.dynamisprc.com)**.

I'm really passionate about what I study: I think *engineering is the missing link between our imagination and real world*! Electronics is my field of study: although my Bachelor Degree is in Computer Science, I wanted to figure out what was under it and what makes thing move. That's why I like when both of the two world mix together.

I joined Dynamis PRC, a **Formula Student** racing team in 2022. I work in the **Electronics and Powertrain** department focusing on the *Battery Management System* and the *Accumulator* of our electric car.

When I'm not studying (ðŸ˜…) or messing around with computers and electronics, I love listening to music and play bass, whatching F1 or hanging out and exploring places with my friends.

I'm making this website in my free time, to explore and share new things. So thanks for checking out!
